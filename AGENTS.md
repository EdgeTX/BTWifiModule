## Project

BTWifiModule is a FrSky Bluetooth emulator for the ESP32, used inside
OpenTX/EdgeTX radios. It emulates the FrSky Bluetooth module over a UART link
and exposes BLE (GATT service `0xFFF0`, characteristic `0xFFF6`).

- Primary target: **ESP32-C3 SuperMini** (`PCB_C3SUPERMINI`). **ESP32-DEV-38P**
  (`PCB_WROOM`, environments `ESP32_DEV38P*`) is the second supported board.
- Reference targets (not hardware-validated): the **ESP32-S3 SuperMini**
  (`ESP32S3SuperMini*`), the ESP32 Pico entries (`pico32`, `RM_pico` and their
  `_nimble` variants) and the **RadioMaster Wireless Module** (`RM_Wireless*`),
  kept for community testing. The Wireless Module's Bluedroid and NimBLE builds
  have been smoke-tested over USB/BLE (AT bench, advertising, GATT, telemetry,
  status LED) but not with a radio; see `doc/BENCH.md` before promoting it.
- BLE hosts: **Bluedroid** (default) and **NimBLE** (`USE_NIMBLE`), sharing the
  same application code behind `#if defined(USE_NIMBLE)`.
- Reference radio: Radiomaster TX16S MK3 with EdgeTX.

## Language

- **All code comments, docstrings, commit messages, and documentation are in
  English.** Do not introduce Spanish (or any other language) comments.
- Public APIs are documented with Doxygen (`/** ... */`) on every function and
  type in the headers.

## Coding conventions

- C99, ESP-IDF style.
- `snake_case` for functions and files; module prefixes are mandatory:
  - `bt_*` / `bt_addr_*` / `at_command_*` / `cbuf_*` / `settings_*`
  - `bt_server_*` (peripheral), `bt_client_*` (central)
- `role_t`, `ble_board_type`, `at_command_t` are the shared enums.
- Headers use `#pragma once`.
- Pure, platform-independent logic lives in dedicated modules (`bt_addr`,
  `at_command`, `cbuf`) so it can be unit-tested on the host.

## Architecture

```
src/
  main.c          Entry point (NVS + UART task).
  board.h         Board config: UART/pins and shared types.
  at_command.c/h  Pure AT command parser (host-testable).
  bt_addr.c/h     Pure BT address conversion (host-testable).
  cb.c/h          Byte circular buffer (host-testable).
  settings.c/h    Persistent config (NVS) with protected access.
  bt.c/h          Common BT stack control (Bluedroid/NimBLE).
  bt_server.c/h   GATT peripheral (0xFFF0).
  bt_client.c/h   GATT central (scan/connect/auto-connect).
  terminal.c/h    UART link: AT dispatch + connection state machines.
test/             Unity unit tests (native).
tools/            Bench tooling: sport_sender.py, at_bench.py, battery.py.
boards/           Custom PlatformIO board definitions.
webflash/         Browser flasher page (ESP Web Tools) and its manifests.
doc/BENCH.md      Bench setup, procedure and validated targets.
```

### Test conventions (PlatformIO Unity, native)

PlatformIO links every `test/*.c` file into a single native binary, so there is
**exactly one `main()`** (in `test/test_main.c`). Each module test file only
defines `test_*` functions plus a `run_xxx_tests()` that invokes `RUN_TEST` for
its tests; `test_main.c` calls every `run_xxx_tests()` between
`UNITY_BEGIN()`/`UNITY_END()`. Do not add `main()`/`app_main()` to module test
files.

### Bench conventions (hardware)

Hardware validation lives in `doc/BENCH.md` and the scripts under `tools/`
(`sport_sender.py` for S.Port injection, `at_bench.py` for the AT command
bench, `battery.py` for the two-board run). Run `tools/at_bench.py` before
marking a target validated; all checks must pass. Keep the validated-target
matrix in `doc/BENCH.md` and the summary in `README.md` up to date when a target
is tested.

## Concurrency rules (do not regress)

- BT GAP/GATT callbacks run in the BT controller task; the UART task runs the
  state machines. Shared state must be synchronized.
- **Never call blocking NVS writes from a BT callback.** Use
  `settings_request_save()` and let the UART task flush it via
  `settings_process()`.
- The scanned-device list is protected by a mutex; use the accessors
  `bt_client_scanned_count()` / `bt_client_scanned_get()` instead of touching
  the array directly.
- `volatile bool` connection flags are single-byte and single-core safe, but do
  not add new shared multi-byte state without a mutex.

## EdgeTX protocol contract (do not change blindly)

Key invariants:

- All responses are terminated with `\r\n`.
- The real ACK that advances EdgeTX is the `Central:<addr>` / `Peripheral:<addr>`
  line emitted by `sendBTMode()` after `AT+TXPW` / `AT+ROLE`.
- Trainer and S.Port are `0x7E`-delimited and byte-stuffed (`0x7D ^ 0x20`);
  CRSF/Ghost are forwarded raw. The module is a pure passthrough.
- Master trainer = central (`AT+ROLE1`), slave/telemetry = peripheral
  (`AT+ROLE0`).
- The firmware stays at 115200 baud; `AT+BAUD4` is acknowledged implicitly by
  EdgeTX switching to 115200 without checking a response.

## Build & test

```bash
pio run -e C3SuperMini          # C3 SuperMini, Bluedroid
pio run -e C3SuperMini_nimble   # C3 SuperMini, NimBLE
pio run -e ESP32_DEV38P         # ESP32-DEV-38P, Bluedroid
pio run -e ESP32_DEV38P_nimble  # ESP32-DEV-38P, NimBLE
pio run -e ESP32S3SuperMini     # ESP32-S3 SuperMini (reference), Bluedroid
pio run -e ESP32S3SuperMini_nimble  # ESP32-S3 SuperMini (reference), NimBLE
pio run -e RM_Wireless          # RadioMaster Wireless Module (reference), Bluedroid
pio run -e RM_Wireless_nimble   # RadioMaster Wireless Module (reference), NimBLE
pio test -e native              # host unit tests (requires gcc)
```

- Platform: `espressif32@6.10.0` (ESP-IDF v5.4.0), matching the committed
  `sdkconfig.*` files.
- Each environment selects exactly one `PCB_*` macro in `src/board.h` and its
  own `sdkconfig.<env>` file, which PlatformIO's ESP-IDF builder picks up by
  environment name. Custom boards live in `boards/`.
- `.github/workflows/build-firmware.yml` runs the native tests and builds the
  supported targets (`C3SuperMini`, `C3SuperMini_nimble`, `ESP32_DEV38P`,
  `ESP32_DEV38P_nimble`). `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds those plus the
  reference ESP32-S3 SuperMini and Pico environments and publishes the web
  flasher. Do not add a reference board to `build-firmware.yml` before it has
  been hardware-validated.
- The remaining environments in `platformio.ini` are kept for reference, are
  not built by CI and are not hardware-validated (see `doc/BENCH.md`).
- The logging console: USB Serial JTAG on the C3 SuperMini (its radio link uses
  UART0's default GPIO20/21) and on the ESP32-S3 SuperMini (radio link on
  UART0's default GPIO43/44), UART0 on the ESP32-DEV-38P (CP2102 bridge) and
  UART1 on the Radiomaster Pico (its radio link uses UART0).

### Web flasher (browser flashing)

`webflash/index.html` picks a manifest by `<board>-<host>`. For every new
board/host combination add `webflash/manifest-<board>-<host>.json`, extend the
board list in `webflash/index.html` and add the matching `place` line to
`.github/workflows/pages.yml`. The binaries are generated by that workflow;
`webflash/firmware/` is gitignored. Mark community/test builds as reference in
the page.

## Definition of done

- Compiles clean (no warnings) for every environment built by CI
  (`C3SuperMini`, `C3SuperMini_nimble`, `ESP32_DEV38P`, `ESP32_DEV38P_nimble`)
  and for any reference environment that was touched.
- New pure logic has host unit tests in `test/`.
- Public functions have Doxygen comments; all comments are in English.
- Hardware-tested targets are reflected in `doc/BENCH.md` and `README.md`.
