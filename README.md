# BTWifiModule

FrSky Bluetooth emulator for ESP32, to be used inside an OpenTX/EdgeTX radio.
It emulates a FrSky Bluetooth module and adds **Bluetooth telemetry** (S.Port and
CRSF), **auto-connect** and a **selectable BLE host** (Bluedroid or NimBLE).

Based on the community project by **dlktdr**
(https://github.com/dlktdr/BTWifiModule).
Documentation: https://btwifimod.gitbook.io/

## How telemetry works

In *Telemetry* mode EdgeTX forwards the radio's telemetry over the BT serial
link. The module passes those bytes to the connected BLE central unchanged:

- FrSky models: S.Port frames, `0x7E`-delimited and byte-stuffed.
- ELRS/CRSF models: raw CRSF frames.

The client app auto-detects the protocol, so both work over the same GATT
service (`0xFFF0`, characteristic `0xFFF6`, NOTIFY).

- S.Port: **INAV / Telemetry Viewer**.
- CRSF: the maintained fork by **RomanLut**
  (https://github.com/RomanLut/android-taranis-smartport-telemetry/releases).

## Hardware

- Primary target: **ESP32-C3 SuperMini**; also supported: **ESP32-DEV-38P**.
  The other board environments in `platformio.ini` (including the
  **ESP32-S3 SuperMini**) are kept for reference (see
  [Validated targets](#validated-targets)).
- **Radiomaster TX16S MK3** with **EdgeTX** (a recent nightly is recommended).

> **TX16S MK3 note.** EdgeTX needs PR #7855 (`BT_PWR_GPIO = PC13` in
> `targets/tx16smk3/hal.h`) to power the AUX2/BT connector. It is included in
> current nightlies.

## Wiring

The module talks to the radio over a 3.3 V UART link (8N1, 115200 baud). Only
TX, RX and GND are required; add +5V if the module is powered from the radio.
The data lines are **crossed**: the module TX goes to the radio RX and the
module RX to the radio TX. Keep GND common with the radio, and power the module
from a supply that can handle the ESP32 current peaks.

| Board | UART | Module TX -> radio RX | Module RX <- radio TX | Flash / logs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ESP32-C3 SuperMini | UART1 | GPIO21 | GPIO20 | native USB Serial/JTAG |
| ESP32-DEV-38P | UART2 | GPIO18 | GPIO19 | on-board CP2102 (UART0) |
| ESP32-S3 SuperMini *(reference)* | UART1 | GPIO43 | GPIO44 | native USB Serial/JTAG |
| ESP32 Pico Kit *(reference)* | UART2 | GPIO4 | GPIO5 | UART0 (default console) |
| Radiomaster Pico *(reference)* | UART0 | GPIO1 | GPIO3 | UART1 — GPIO20 (TX) / GPIO19 (RX) |
| RadioMaster Wireless Module *(reference)* | UART0 | GPIO1 | GPIO3 | USB-C CP2102 (UART0 shared, no log console) |

The pins are selected per environment through the `PCB_*` macro in
`src/board.h`. On the C3 SuperMini the radio uses UART1 on GPIO20/21 (the
default UART0 pins), so the log console is routed to the native USB Serial/JTAG
port instead of UART0; the ESP32-S3 SuperMini uses the same approach with the
default UART0 pins on GPIO43/44. On the ESP32-DEV-38P the on-board CP2102
bridge keeps UART0 free for flashing and logs. On the Radiomaster Pico the radio
link uses UART0, so the log console is moved to UART1. On the RadioMaster
Wireless Module a CH442E mux selected by USB VBUS connects UART0 either to the
radio bay or to the CP2102, leaving no pin for a log console: that target is
built silent to keep the AT link clean. Its on-board WS2812 LED (GPIO18) shows
the link state: red = idle, green = radio traffic, blue = BLE peer connected,
cyan = both.

The reference rows are the community builds (see
[Validated targets](#validated-targets)); the Wireless Module has only been
validated over USB/BLE so far, not against a radio.

## EdgeTX protocol

The module speaks the FrSky Bluetooth AT protocol over an 8N1 UART link at
115200 baud. All responses are `\r\n`-terminated; the real ACK that advances
EdgeTX is the `Central:<addr>` / `Peripheral:<addr>` line emitted after
`AT+TXPW` / `AT+ROLE`. Trainer and S.Port frames are `0x7E`-delimited and
byte-stuffed, while CRSF/Ghost are forwarded raw. See `AGENTS.md` for the full
set of protocol invariants.

## Building

PlatformIO (ESP-IDF). Two BLE hosts are selectable: Bluedroid (default) or
NimBLE.

**Supported targets** (app partition 1 MB):

| Environment | BLE host | Flash | Board |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C3SuperMini` | Bluedroid | ~84 % | ESP32-C3 SuperMini |
| `C3SuperMini_nimble` | NimBLE | ~52 % | ESP32-C3 SuperMini |
| `ESP32_DEV38P` | Bluedroid | ~86 % | ESP32-DEV-38P |
| `ESP32_DEV38P_nimble` | NimBLE | ~53 % | ESP32-DEV-38P |

**Reference targets** (not hardware-validated). The ESP32-S3 SuperMini uses the
default 1 MB app partition; the Pico boards use 1.31 MB via
`pico_partitions.csv`; the Wireless Module uses 3 MB via
`rm_wireless_partitions.csv`:

| Environment | BLE host | Flash | Board |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ESP32S3SuperMini` | Bluedroid | ~78 % | ESP32-S3 SuperMini |
| `ESP32S3SuperMini_nimble` | NimBLE | ~52 % | ESP32-S3 SuperMini |
| `RM_pico` | Bluedroid | ~65 % | Radiomaster Pico |
| `RM_pico_nimble` | NimBLE | ~41 % | Radiomaster Pico |
| `pico32` | Bluedroid | ~65 % | ESP32 Pico Kit |
| `pico32_nimble` | NimBLE | ~41 % | ESP32 Pico Kit |
| `RM_Wireless` | Bluedroid | ~24 % | RadioMaster Wireless Module |
| `RM_Wireless_nimble` | NimBLE | ~17 % | RadioMaster Wireless Module |

The Wireless Module rows are the same application code, and both builds have
been checked end to end over USB/BLE: advertising, service `0xFFF0` /
characteristic `0xFFF6`, S.Port telemetry decoded by the phone app and the
on-board status LED. The radio bay and the central/headtracker runs are still
untested, so it stays in this table.

```bash
pio run -e C3SuperMini -t upload          # C3 SuperMini, Bluedroid
pio run -e C3SuperMini_nimble -t upload   # C3 SuperMini, NimBLE
pio run -e ESP32S3SuperMini -t upload     # ESP32-S3 SuperMini, Bluedroid
pio run -e RM_pico -t upload              # Radiomaster Pico, Bluedroid
pio run -e RM_Wireless -t upload          # RadioMaster Wireless Module, Bluedroid
```

The Bluedroid path is kept behind `#if !defined(USE_NIMBLE)`, so both hosts
share the same application code. See [Wiring](#wiring) for the UART pins of each
board.

## Web flasher

A browser-based flasher (ESP Web Tools) is published from this repository
through GitHub Pages. Open the Pages URL in a Chromium-based browser
(Chrome/Edge) over HTTPS, connect the board over USB and pick a **board** and a
**Bluetooth host**:

- Boards: **ESP32-C3 SuperMini** (`C3SuperMini*`) and **ESP32-DEV-38P**
  (`ESP32_DEV38P*`).
- Reference builds: **ESP32-S3 SuperMini** (`ESP32S3SuperMini*`), **Radiomaster
  Pico** (`RM_pico*`), **RadioMaster Wireless Module** (`RM_Wireless*`, same
  UART0 pins as the Radiomaster Pico; its BLE side is validated over USB, the
  radio bay is not) and **ESP32 Pico Kit** (`pico32*`). They differ in the radio
  UART pins, so if one does not work, try the other.
- Hosts: **Bluedroid** (default) and **NimBLE**.

Every board is offered with both hosts (each combination is a separate build).
The page is built and deployed by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. Enable it once
under **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
Press RESET on the board after flashing.

## Validated targets

Hardware validation status of the current firmware. The bench procedure is in
`doc/BENCH.md`.

| Target | BLE host | AT commands | Slave + telemetry | Master | Headtracker |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ESP32-C3 SuperMini | Bluedroid | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| ESP32-C3 SuperMini | NimBLE | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| ESP32-DEV-38P | Bluedroid | PASS | PASS | n/t | PASS |
| ESP32-DEV-38P | NimBLE | PASS | PASS | n/t | PASS |

`n/t` = not tested (the ESP32-DEV-38P was validated against the phone and the
headtracker, without a board-to-board master run).

Partial validation (BLE path over USB, no radio yet):

| Target | BLE host | AT commands | Slave + telemetry | Master | Headtracker |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RadioMaster Wireless Module | Bluedroid | PASS | PASS | n/t | n/t |
| RadioMaster Wireless Module | NimBLE | PASS | PASS | n/t | n/t |

Both hosts pass the full `tools/at_bench.py` (16 checks) and the phone checks
described in `doc/BENCH.md`; the radio bay (`J4`), central mode and the
headtracker are not tested yet.

The other board environments in `platformio.ini` (ESP32 Pico, ESP32-S3
SuperMini, C3 DevKitM-1, Node32s Wroom32, Radiomaster Pico) are kept for
reference and are not hardware-validated with this version. The ESP32-S3
SuperMini, the two Pico boards and the Wireless Module are additionally built by
the web flasher workflow so they can be tried from the browser.

## Tests

The pure modules (`cb`, `at_command`, `bt_addr`) have unit tests under `test/`:

```bash
pio test -e native
```

## AT command set

The module speaks the same AT protocol EdgeTX uses for the FrSky Bluetooth
module:

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AT+BAUD4` | baud rate level (this firmware stays at 115200) |
| `AT+NAME<name>` | set the Bluetooth name (persisted and advertised) |
| `AT+TXPW<n>` | TX power (acknowledged) |
| `AT+ROLE0` | Peripheral (telemetry / trainer slave) |
| `AT+ROLE1` | Central (trainer master) |
| `AT+DISC?` | start a scan (central) |
| `AT+CON<addr>` | connect to a device (central) |
| `AT+CLEAR` | forget the saved device |
| `AT+HTRESET` | reset the headtracker (BTWifiModule extension) |

Responses: `OK+...`, `Central:<addr>`, `Peripheral:<addr>`, `Connected:<addr>`,
`DisConnected`, `ERROR`.
